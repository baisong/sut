SUT: Simple Universal Time
==========================

This repository contains a C file that prints the current SUT.

To compile on Linux (with build-essential already installed) run: 

```
cc sut.c -o sut
```

This utility was inspired by http://telmich.github.io/sut/ and built for the purpose of being able to embed SUT in my statusbar on Linux.
